**CMSC 436 Project Proposal: Sudoku Puzzle**

**Project Team 27**

- Ben Romalis
- Ben Horton
- Mateos O’Connor

**App Description**

This app is a basic sudoku game. We will have 3 settings for the difficulty of play (easy, medium, and hard).

**Minimal Goals**

- The app will randomly generate new unique sudoku puzzles (easy, medium, or hard) upon user request from the main menu screen.
- Users will be able to clear the board and restart the puzzle by shaking their phone.  A message will pop up asking the user if they really want to clear the board.
- There will be an undo button.
  - Possibly a message if they get too many inputs wrong (more than 2-3 mistakes there is an alert?)
  - After a couple of mistakes, the incorrect cells can be colored red
- There will be buttons for each number 1-9
- Cell coloring, such as yellow for cells you are unsure about(yellow color like a notepad)

**Stretch Goals**

- Give users the option to use light or dark mode.  Possibly switch from light to dark mode automatically based on time of day or brightness in the room.
- Give users hints if they ask for them.
- Track how long it takes to complete the board
- “Share” option to challenge friends to complete it and get a better time
- Scan a written sudoku puzzle(from a newspaper or booklet), and translate it into the application so it can be worked on through your phone/tablet

**Project Timeline**

**Milestone 1 - March 18th**

- Create the different screens (Main Menu, Sudoku Board), and their appearance in portrait mode and landscape mode.
- Different Level of Difficulties => Different background (could just be change of color)

**Milestone 2 - April 1st**

- Complete most/all UI and logic for the application.
- Sudoku Randomizer can be saved until Milestone 3, until then we can just use one board until then

**Milestone 3 - April 15th**

- Application will be tested to ensure the minimal goals are fulfilled completely.
- Stretch Goals have been discussed and in the process of being implemented

**Final Submission - May 2nd**

Stretch goals completed, project submitted, and a demonstration scheduled.

**Possible: Movie review social media app. Add friends and review movies you watch so that you can see what your friends have been watching and know whether or not you would like it. Shake your phone to give a movie 1 star and a review of “would not recommend.”**
