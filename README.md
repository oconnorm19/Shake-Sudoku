This is where your group will put your project, the Next Big Thing
in apps!

## General Requirements

You must implement the project in Swift, using SwiftUI for the View.
You *may not* use external libraries or frameworks without prior
approval. Firebase is an approved framework. If you wish to use
functionality from UIKit or other built-in frameworks, you may, but
the bulk of your interface must still be in SwiftUI. In particular, for
UIKit, you should limit yourselves to the *bare minimum* functionality
needed. When in doubt, ask.

Your project must go beyond the topics we covered in class in some
significant way, and must somehow take advantage of features of a
mobile device (mobility, camera, motion sensors, etc.).

## Deliverables

You will need to submit the following things:

 1. a project proposal
 2. Milestone 1
 3. Milestone 2
 4. Milestone 3
 5. Final project, which must include
    * a working Xcode project
    * a 5-10 page report
    * a short (about 5 minutes) demonstration video

See below for details about these.

## How to Submit

Your project will be a series of commits, starting with a project proposal.
This proposal can be in markdown, plain text, or PDF, and should have an
obvious name. In addition, you should include an Xcode project, as with the
solo projects.

We will discuss your proposal with you, so that it is appropriately scoped
for difficulty (not too easy, nor too hard), and has clearly-identified
milestones, minimal goals, and stretch goals. There will be three milestone
submissions before the final submission.

The final submission must include the following:

 * an Xcode project that builds and runs on the iPhone 12 simulator
 * a 5-10 page (roughtly 2500 to 5000 words) report describing not just your
   app, but your design process, and how your ideas evolved over the course
   of the project
 * a 5 minute screen recording of your app, including audio description; several
   apps will be selected for in-class demonstration based on these

## Format of the Proposal

Your proposal should have the following format:

 * Project title
 * List of team members
 * General description of the app
 * Minimal Goals -- these are things your app *must* do
 * Stretch Goals -- these are additional functionality that might earn extra points
 * Project timeline, including development milestones

We have provided a sample proposal on ELMS that corresponds to the in-class
exercises. Your proposal will obviously have to include functionality beyond
what we will do for these exercises.

## Format of the Milestones

Your milestone document should be named either `MilestoneX.txt`,
`MilestoneX.md`, or `MilestoneX.pdf`, where `X` is the milestone number
(1, 2, or 3). It must be committed to your repository and pushed to the
server.

In this, list what you have accomplished, and if you did not meet your
proposed target for the milestone, provide an updated schedule
illustrating how you will complete the project on time. Feel free to
include any design changes or lessons learned. These will be useful
when putting together your final report.

Your code should also be up-to-date on the server, so that we can
verify that actual progress is being made. It does not need to be
completely functional.

Please note that any real-world project is likely to require at least
slight schedule adjustments. *Don't panic if you didn't meet all of your
initial milestone goals!* The purpose of the milestones is for us to
check on your progress and provide feedback as needed.

## Format of the Final Report

The final report for your project should be titled `Final.txt`, `Final.md`,
or `Final.pdf`. It should have the following sections:

 * Title
 * Overview describing the motivation and high-level concept of the app
 * List of goals, where each is described, not just a bullet list
 * Walk-through of user interactions, including screen captures (the
   simulator has a built-in screenshot button)
 * Discussion of the development process, including when/how tasks were
   completed; any setbacks encountered; decisions and changes made to
   the initial plan; and what you learned, both about the development
   process and the features you used that were not covered in class
 * Potential future directions
