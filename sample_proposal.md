# CMSC436 Project Proposal: Watchlist

## Project Team 123

 * Tom Servo
 * Crow T. Robot
 * Joel Robinson

## App Description

This app will allow a user to track their TV viewing, including
where they watch a show (network TV, streaming service, etc.),
whether they're currently watching it, and other assorted information.

## Minimal Goals

The app will contain a list of TV shows, with an interface that allows
the user to add or delete shows. For each show, the user will be able
to select:

 * Where/how they watch it
 * Whether it's a show they're currently watching
 * The show's genre or genres
 * A rating of how much they enjoy the show

## Stretch Goals

We have identified the following stretch goals:

 * Free-text notes about the show
 * Links to the show or information about the show
 * Images or clips from the show

## Project Timeline

### Milestone 1

 * The ability to enter information about a new show
 * A scrollable list of the shows currently entered
 * A toggle to set/display whether a show is currently
   being watched

### Milestone 2

 * A separate tab to display details about a show; this
   is where the toggle control will be located
 * A selector for one or more genres, with the ability to add
   new genres
 * A stepper or picker to select a star rating

### Milestone 3

The minimal features will be fully implemented and nicely
displayed:

 * The detail view will have the watch toggle, genres, and
   rating, as well as a "delete" button
 * The list view will have an "add" button for new shows, and
   will select long-press to delete a show from the list
 * The list display will also include icons indicating the
   genres, the star rating, and a visual indicator of whether
   the show is being watched

At this point, we will begin working on the stretch goals

### Final submission

Stretch goals completed, project submitted, and a demonstration
scheduled.
